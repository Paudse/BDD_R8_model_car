# model_car
The model car source codes adapted from Karl Zipser's kzpy3.1

# master branch
The master branch reorganized the file structure as follows:
Arduino/ -- the arduino source codes
model_car/ -- the deep learning framework running on jestson TX1
ros/ -- ros related codes

# keras branch
The keras branch ported the caffe version to keras version.
It currently only provide the testing phase of the model.
The training phase codes would be updated later.
